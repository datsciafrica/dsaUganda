        <h1>Background </h1>
        <p>Several Ugandan institutions are already harnessing data using Artificial Intelligence (AI) or simple analytics for decision making, developing new services and products, and ensuring quality customer service. It is also true that many Ugandans knowingly or unknowingly interact daily with AI-powered applications especially on their mobile phones. But on the other hand, many other Ugandans are not yet aware of the potential and benefits of leveraging data and using AI or Data Science. There are costs involved in the non-use of data, including making unwise decisions following gut feelings or instinct instead of evidence or insights derived from data.</p>
        
        <h1>About the <em>Launch</em></h1>
        <p>The launch is aimed at showcasing what is happening in the artificial intelligence (AI), data , data  science and innovation space in Uganda, but also to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>bring together partners working in the data science space within the country drawn from government, private sector, academia, civil society and international organisations; </li>
            <li>increase interest, awareness and ownership in data science among stakeholders;
            </li>
            <li>to communicate the agenda of the local chapter so that the people can be aware of what is available on offer and stimulate discussion on the partnership.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>We are expecting more than 30 exhibitors drawn from government, academia, private sector, civil society and international organisations and around 150 participants. It is a hybrid event and many participants will be connecting online. </p>
        
        <h1>About Data Science Africa - <em>Uganda (DSAU)</em></h1>
        <p>DSAU is a local chapter of Data Science Africa (DSA). DSA is a network of data science professionals and enthusiasts focused on developing contextual data science solutions for African challenges. DSA has held ten week-long events (consisting of 3-day training and 2-day of workshop) in six countries, including  Uganda (2016, 2020), Kenya (2015, 2018), Tanzania (2017, 2022), Ethiopia (2019), Nigeria ( 2018), Ghana (2019), and South Africa (2021). Other programs include research grants (DSA Research Award 2019, African AI Research Awards - Junior Researchers and Early Career, visiting fellowships, and mentorship programmes.</p>
        <p>DSA Uganda will replicate DSA programmes but also introduce more as and when proposed and evaluated to meet the local needs. DSA Uganda has already convened four events attracting participation from over 28 academic institutions, 23 government MDAs, 26 private sector companies and 14 from other categories. DSA Uganda will unveil a roadmap for the coming six months at the launch that we would like you to be a part of
