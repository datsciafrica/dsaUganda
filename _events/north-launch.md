  abstract:"Modelling physical/natural systems as networks is one of fast-growing research areas in applied mathematics. These systems include: social, bio-stochastics, telecommunication, queuing, reliability systems and citation networks. Importantly, attributes (nodes) of such systems are usually millions or billions. In some instances, the attributes can be few but the system keep changing from time to time this dynamics phenomenon rather exist algorithms ineffective. Moreover, networks models are recognised as potential objects to filter information from such systems.  In fact, modelling physical or engineering systems as networks have greatly improved understanding of complex systems. <br>In this talk, the popular Markov models commonly used in ranking (PageRank) problems will be presented.   The focus will be on analysis of information Markov chain, where the phase spaces split into non-communicative groups of states. Recent analytical and numerical results will be given."
