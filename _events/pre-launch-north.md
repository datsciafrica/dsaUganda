  abstract: "In order to realize the idea of document enrichment we developed a tool called TermPedia which predicts and defines technical terms. The definitions are extracted from Wikipedia, and the technical terms are also linked to contextually relevant Wikipedia articles which provide further explanation for the definitions. This paper presents results from a user study that was carried out to find out the effect of document enrichment on e-learning from educational documents (textbooks). In particular the study tried to answer the following questions, 1. Does document enrichment improve understanding of an e-content? 2. Does document enrichment reduce the time needed to e-Learn from an educational document?"

  abstract: "Modelling physical/natural systems as networks is one of fast-growing research areas in applied mathematics. These systems include: social, bio-stochastics, telecommunication, queuing, reliability systems and citation networks. Importantly, attributes (nodes) of such systems are usually millions or billions. In some instances, the attributes can be few but the system keep changing from time to time this dynamics phenomenon rather exist algorithms ineffective. Moreover, networks models are recognised as potential objects to filter information from such systems.  In fact, modelling physical or engineering systems as networks have greatly improved understanding of complex systems. <br>In this talk, the popular Markov models commonly used in ranking (PageRank) problems will be presented.   The focus will be on analysis of information Markov chain, where the phase spaces split into non-communicative groups of states. Recent analytical and numerical results will be given."
