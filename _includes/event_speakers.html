                                        Ernest Mwebaze has had a dual career in academia and in industry. He possesses
                                        over 10 years of teach- ing experience in computer science and machine learning.
                                        While at Makerere University he co-found- ed the Makerere University Artificial
                                        Intelligence research lab leading it to prominence in the field of practical
                                        implementation and deployment of artificial intelligence solutions.<br> In
                                        industry he has worked at the Google AI research lab in Ghana and the UN Pulse
                                        lab in Kampala where he focused on practical applications of artificial
                                        intelligence to tackle developmental challenges in agriculture, utility
                                        estimation and different focus areas of the SDGs. He is passionate about using
                                        artificial intelligence to improve society particularly in developing parts of
                                        the world. He is currently the executive director of Sunbird AI.</p>
